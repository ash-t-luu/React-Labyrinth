## Overview
React Server Components operate exclusively on the server, enabling tasks such as executing database queries within the component itself, rather than relying on backend requests. This paradigm distinguishes them from traditional React components, known as Client Components. However, identifying which Client Components could be optimized as Server Components isn't always straightforward, potentially leading to inefficient bundle sizes and longer time to interactive (TTI) for clients.

To address this challenge, we aim to develop a visualization tool to help developers determine their application's component types. By enhancing component-type visibility and aiding in the transition to server components, our tool empowers developers to optimize their applications effectively.

## Installation

React Labyrinth extension can be installed via the VSCode Marketplace. Start by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VSCode or by using the View: Extensions command (Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for 'react-labyrinth' and click the "install" button. Upon completion, VSCode will have installed the extension and React Labyrinth is ready for use.

Upon activation, a sidebar will appear, featuring a 'View Tree' button. Clicking this button will prompt the file explorer to open, allowing you to select the root file of your React App to load the tree structure.

Client Components will be distinguished by a orange background, while Server Components will feature an blue background for easy identification.
